# Mute a user

If you would like to stop receiving notifications from a certain user, you can
choose to mute him/her.

Please note that muting a user only mutes notifications for **@-mentions** and **Private messages**
from a muted user, that is, those messages will still be in view. Group private
messages and stream messages will remain unmuted.

There are three main ways of muting a user which boils down to basically one way;
you can mute a user by clicking on message sender or @-mention or through users list
in the right sidebar.

## Mute a user by clicking message sender

1. Find any message, the user you want to mute, has posted and click on the sender
(name) of the message, you will see a popover opens with last option showing to **Mute**
the person.

2. Upon clicking **Mute** option, you will see a tooltip titled **User Muted**, confirming
the muting operation.

## Mute a user by clicking @-mention

1. Find any message having the user, you want to mute, mentioned in it and click on the
**mentioned** part, you will see a popover opens with last option showing to **Mute**
the person.

2. Upon clicking **Mute** option, you will see a tooltip titled **User Muted**, confirming
the muting operation.

## Mute a user through users list

1. Find the users section in the right sidebar, and hover on the user you want to mute.

2. Upon hovering, you will see a down chevron (<i class="icon-vector-chevron-down"></i>).
Click it, and a popover opens with last option showing to **Mute** the person.

3. Upon clicking **Mute** option, you will see a tooltip titled **User Muted**, confirming
the muting operation.

## Unmute a user through user popover

1. Follow any of the steps mentioned above to mute a user, and instead of seeing an option to
**Mute** the person, you will see an **Unmute** option.

2. Click that **Unmute** option, and again open the popover by any of the methods mentioned
above, if you see an option to **Mute**, your unmuting operation was a success.

muted after him/her.

3. Click on the **Unmute** link to the right of the user you want to unmute.

from that user for @-mentions and private messages, and if the user popover shows
an option to **Mute** the person, your unmuting operation was a success.
